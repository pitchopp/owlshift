//! The git ref layout: claims and per-ticket state.

//! `refs/owlshift/claims/<ticket>` points to a commit whose tree holds
//! [`CLAIM_FILE`]; `refs/owlshift/tickets/<ticket>` points to a commit whose
//! tree holds [`STATE_FILE`], [`QUESTIONS_FILE`] and, later, the ticket's

//! checkout only; pushing it to the remote comes with claims (P7).
